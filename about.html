        <p class="py-10 m-20">Hello, My name is James, I am an IT student that is currently studying in the University of the Cordilleras. 
            I am making this project for a subject i am currently taking this semester. 
            And as you can see, I am still new to Web Development.</p>
        <p class="py-36 text-right">I had lived in this city for all my life but for some reason, i dont feel like I'm getting bored of it. 
            I still often find something interesting in this cozy city. My hobbies are playing games, listening to music, reading, and watching views (i know, very unique). I do like trying out new things even though I am not familiar (or good) with it, just like making this portfolio.
